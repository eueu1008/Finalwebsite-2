  <div id="Biolong">
    <span>Andy Warhol was born in Pittsburgh and moved to New York in 1949 after studying </br>design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh to become a commercial</br> artist. Andy Warhol soon became a successful and highly paid consumer advertise-</br>ment designer in New York. He then switched his career to creating art for galleries</br> and became a representative artist of the 1960s pop art movement. Pop art was</br> inspired by the imagery of popular culture, which celebrated and criticized consum-</br>ption choices and mass production. Andy Warhol worked in a wide range of media </br>such as printmaking, painting, hand drawing, performance art, silk screening, sculp-</br>ture, photography, music and film. Warhols most well known artworks are images of </br>soup cans, soda bottles, dollar bills, and iconic paintings of Mick Jagger, Elvis Pres-</br>ley, Marilyn Monroe and many more. After his fame reached high, he built a studio </br>called The Factory on 47th street. His goal as an artist was to bring popular styles</br> and subjects into the world of high class art. <br/></span>
